String-Edit Distance

Sample output is provided in 'test1.txt' and 'test2.txt' for the
requested edits.  This code can be run with 'python se_dist.py'.

The initial string is on the first line, under 'init'.
Successive lines show the operation used, its cost,
and the total string edit cost.  The last line shows the finished
string, and the total cost on this line is the final cost.
