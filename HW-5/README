HW5: Compounds
Computational Linguistics

The code for the algorithm is in 'comp_prob.py'.  To execute it, simply run it with python.
There are no arguments.  The corpus and gold standard are coded into the algorithm.

The corpus being used is 'browncorpus_simplewords.txt'.
The gold standard being used it 'final_gold_standard.txt'.

An interesting thing detected during testing is that PMI doesn't actually discover
any significant number of words that the lexicon and hyphen method missed.  This led me
to attempt to refine the other parts of the algorithm first.

Sample output is provided, under 'output.txt'.  It contains the precision and recall
of the algorithm, as well as a list of the compounds that were correctly identified from
the gold standard.

Note that my gold standard has a few modifications for correctness, though it is still far
from perfect.
