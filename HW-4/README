HMM Week 2
4 February 2013

To get an output table, simply run the python script 'hmm.py'.
The script is set to run on the first 1000 words of the Brown Corpus,
stored in 'brown_1000.txt'.

The script has been modified from HW4. It no longer outputs the ratios
of state 1 to state 2, and instead carries out the Forward-Backward algorithm
as described in the project description.

The first output is the expected emission results with two states,
and the second output is the expected emission with three states.

Unfortunately, with the time alotted, I was not able to get the 3-state
HMM functioning properly. For that matter, I'm not sure that the 2-state HMM
functions properly either.

For the 2-state, we're supposed to get vowels and consonants.
For the 3-state, I'm unsure what the separation is supposed to be.
